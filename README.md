# Student Loan Repayment Prediction Model

## Background

This project aims to develop a neural network model that predicts the likelihood of student loan repayment. This is essential for our company, which specializes in student loan refinancing, as accurate predictions can lead to better-tailored interest rates for borrowers. The dataset provided contains various details about previous loan recipients, including their credit rankings, which will serve as the basis for our model.

## Instructions

### Prepare the Data for Use on a Neural Network Model

1. **Read the data** from the [student loans dataset](https://static.bc-edx.com/mbc/ai/m6/datasets/student_loans.csv) into a Pandas DataFrame. Review the DataFrame to identify potential features and target variables.
2. **Define the features and target**: 
   - Features (X): All columns except "credit_ranking".
   - Target (y): "credit_ranking" column.
3. **Split the data** into training and testing datasets.
4. **Scale the features** using scikit-learn's `StandardScaler`.

### Compile and Evaluate a Model Using a Neural Network

1. **Create a neural network model**:
   - Use TensorFlow's Keras to design a two-layer deep neural network with the `relu` activation function.
2. **Compile and fit the model**:
   - Use the `mse` loss function and `adam` optimizer.
   - Start with 50 to 100 epochs for training.
3. **Evaluate the model** on the test data to determine its loss and accuracy.
4. **Save the model** to an HDF5 file named `student_loans.h5`.

### Predict Loan Repayment Success by Using Your Neural Network Model

1. **Reload your saved model**.
2. **Make predictions** on the testing data.
3. **Create and display a DataFrame** that shows both the predictions and actual values. Analyze the results and note any insights or discrepancies.

## Conclusion

This project outlines the steps required to predict student loan repayment success, helping our company offer more accurate and personalized refinancing options. By following the instructions above, you'll be able to build, evaluate, and use a neural network model tailored for predicting credit rankings based on historical loan data.
